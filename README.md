## 🌿 What is EcoFinds?

EcoFinds is a **full-stack sustainable marketplace** that connects environmentally-conscious buyers and sellers in a circular economy ecosystem. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms, EcoFinds focuses exclusively on products that promote sustainability - whether they're **pre-loved items**, **recycled goods**, or **eco-friendly alternatives** to conventional products.
